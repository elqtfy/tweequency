# What is it? How does it work?
It is a python automation bot for generative music.<br/>
It goes your Tweetdeck(you don't need a separate account for Tweetdeck, it uses your Twitter account.), and opens the 4 least popular hashtags among Trend column.<br/>
Each time when each column gets updated, Tweequency will play drum sounds, and (hopefully) you can hear some music!<br/>
I used [Selenium](https://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.html) for this project, if you are interested in, go check the link!

# Can I use it?
Sure! you will see ID and password in the line 37 in tweetdeck.py file.<br/> Instead of <creds['ID']> and <creds['password']>, type your tweeter account and enjoy!
You can also listen to specific hashtags you want.
